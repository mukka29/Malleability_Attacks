# MALLEABILITY ATTACKS IN BITCOIN TRANSACTION

CMPSCI5782: Advanced Information Security

- Mini Research Project

## Abstract

Many in the crypto-sphere have heard about the “Bitcoin”. It is a cryptocurrency that has been emerged as a popular medium of exchange of digital money that relies on ‘cryptography’ to generate and validate all the transactions.

The bitcoin network is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen therefore its security aspects are the major area of research among cybersecurity professionals. This currency is vulnerable during the transaction process with millions of transactions flying around which gives the attacker a window to change the identifier of a transaction (the TXID) but without invalidating that transaction which can be referred to as a “Malleability attack”.

The essence of the transaction malleability is the attacker can simply change the transaction ID and his new transaction ID could have been included in the block rather than the original transaction ID and it might then seem as if the original transaction itself never went through – though it effectively did.
